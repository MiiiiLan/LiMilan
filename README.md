Title: 
  Feel The Sky (temp)

Description: 
  How does the sky feel? How do you feel when you look at the sky? This website is about the sky and your's emotions. This is somewhat of a photo album and will all based on my opinion, and my perspective of the world. Each webpage will show a different emotion of the sky, with pictures, descriptions, and my interpretation. Though these are subject to change, the emotions I choose to portray are fear, anger, joy, neutral, and calm. Besides the emotions I have chosen, I may also add in song recomendations that matches the feeling of the picture I use.
